      <title>Attributable Fraction from Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>This example will demonstrate how the attributable fraction ($AF$) can be obtained for survival data. It will also demonstrate the flexibility to calculate various function of standardized estimates through use of the `userfunction()&amp;rsquo; option.
The is defined in epidemiology as the proportion of preventable outcomes if all subjects had not been exposed to a particular exposure. i.e.
$$ AF = \frac{P(D=1) - P(D=1|X=0)}{P(D=1)} $$
where $P(D)$ is proportion diseased in the whole population, and $P(D|X=0)$ is the probability of being diseased in the exposed.</description>

      <title>RMST of Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>Here I will show another useful measure from standardized survival functions. There have been several papers promoting the use of restricted mean survival time (RMST) in clinical trials. The arguments are (i) ease of interpretation (though I am not convinced a restricted mean is that easy to explain) and (ii) providing a simple summary in the presence of non-proportional hazards. See Royston and Parmar (2013) for a description of the use of the measure in RCTs.</description>

      <title>Hazard of Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>This will be a short tutorial as the ideas are very simple. I have previously discussed standardized survival functions. In survival analysis we know that there is a simple mathematical transformation from hazard to survival function and vice versa. The idea here is to transform to a hazard function from the standardized survival function. Recall that a standardized survival funnction; $S_s(t|X=x,Z)$ is estimated by
$$ S_s(t|X=x,Z) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}S(t|X=x,Z=z_i) $$</description>

      <title>Centiles of Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>Background In the previous tutorial I used stpm2_standsurv to obtain standardized survival functions. In this tutorial I show the first of a number of different measures of the standardized survival function where I obtain centiles of the standardized survival function.
As a reminder a centile of a survival function can be obtanined by solving $S(t) = \alpha$ for $t$. For example, for the median survival time we set $\alpha = 0.</description>

      <description>The stpm2_standsurv estimates standardized survival curves and related measures. It also allows various contrasts between the standardized functions. It is a post-estimation command and is used after fitting an stpm2 model.

The hazard function of the standardized survival curve. Estimating attributable fractions in cohort studies Standardized cause-specific cumulative incidence functions.</description>

      <description>Background When we are performing data exploration on survival data we usually start with plotting Kaplan-Meier curves. In clinical trials with a survival outcome, one would nearly always expect to see a Kaplan-Meier curve plotted. They are simple to interpret (though there can be confusion when there are competing risks).
In observational studies, we expect that there will be confounding and would usually adjust for these confounders in a Cox model.</description>
