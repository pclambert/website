      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had to move my webpage as the my university was closing down the server where the last one was hosted. I used this &amp;ldquo;opportunity&amp;rdquo; to create a new webpage using the excellent guide provided &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and some advice from &lt;a href=&#34;http://mjcrowther.co.uk&#34;&gt;Michael Crowther&lt;/a&gt; who has recently started his new website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first ever blog and at the moment I am unsure how often I will do this, but my noble aim when developing this site is to be more active in adding examples and code. I have benefited a lot from many others posting code etc and I feel that this is often the best way of not reinventing the wheel. I also get various emails on the use of some of the commands I have written and many of them will hopefully be answered by referral to a an example on here. Some future requests may turn into new tutorials or blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
