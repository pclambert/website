## Background

In the previous tutorial I used `stpm2_standsurv` to obtain standardized survival functions. In this tutorial I show the first of a 
number of different measures of the standardized survival function where I obtain centiles of the standardized survival function.

As a reminder a centiles of a survival function can be obtanined by solving $S(t) = \alpha$ for $t$. For simple parametric distributions, such as the Weibull, this can be done analytically, but for more complex models the centile is obtained analytically. This what is done when using `stpm2`. 

The centile of a standardized survival function is

$$
E\left(S(t | X=x,Z\right) = \alpha
$$
