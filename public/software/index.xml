      <title>Attributable Fraction from Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>This example will demonstrate how the attributable fraction ($AF$) can be obtained for survival data. It will also demonstrate the flexibility to calculate various function of standardized estimates through use of the `userfunction()&amp;rsquo; option.
The is defined in epidemiology as the proportion of preventable outcomes if all subjects had not been exposed to a particular exposure. i.e.
$$ AF = \frac{P(D=1) - P(D=1|X=0)}{P(D=1)} $$
where $P(D)$ is proportion diseased in the whole population, and $P(D|X=0)$ is the probability of being diseased in the exposed.</description>

      <title>RMST of Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>Here I will show another useful measure from standardized survival functions. There have been several papers promoting the use of restricted mean survival time (RMST) in clinical trials. The arguments are (i) ease of interpretation (though I am not convinced a restricted mean is that easy to explain) and (ii) providing a simple summary in the presence of non-proportional hazards. See Royston and Parmar (2013) for a description of the use of the measure in RCTs.</description>

      <title>Hazard of Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>This will be a short tutorial as the ideas are very simple. I have previously discussed standardized survival functions. In survival analysis we know that there is a simple mathematical transformation from hazard to survival function and vice versa. The idea here is to transform to a hazard function from the standardized survival function. Recall that a standardized survival funnction; $S_s(t|X=x,Z)$ is estimated by
$$ S_s(t|X=x,Z) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}S(t|X=x,Z=z_i) $$</description>

      <title>Centiles of Standardized Survival Functions</title>

      <description>Background In the previous tutorial I used stpm2_standsurv to obtain standardized survival functions. In this tutorial I show the first of a number of different measures of the standardized survival function where I obtain centiles of the standardized survival function.
As a reminder a centile of a survival function can be obtanined by solving $S(t) = \alpha$ for $t$. For example, for the median survival time we set $\alpha = 0.</description>

      <description>The rcsgen command generates basis function for restricted cubic splines. The command is used by my stpm2 command to fit flexible parameric survival models. It has a number of advantages over Stata&amp;rsquo;s inbuilt mkspline command, which will be demonstrated in the tutorials below.
Using rcsgen  Generating splines - use of the knots(), bkknots() and percentiles() options. Using the scalar() option for predictions. Using the center() optin for easier predictions Some issues when orthogonalising.</description>

      <description>Sensitivity analysis to the location of knots When using stpm2 with the df() option the location of the knots for the restricted cubic splines are selected using the defaults. These are the based at the centiles of $\ln(t)$ for the events (i.e. the non censored observations). The boundary knots are placed at the minimum and maximum log event times. For example, with 5 knots there will be knots placed at the $0^{th}$, $25^{th}$, $50^{th}$, $75^{th}$, and $100^{th}$ centiles of the log event times.</description>

      <title>Use of the timevar() option</title>

      <guid>/software/stpm2/stpm2_timevar/</guid>
      <description>Background In this tutorial I will describe some simple use of the timevar() option when obtaining predictions after fitting a model using stpm2. When using Stata&amp;rsquo;s survival models, such as streg and stcox, predictions are made at the values of _t, which is each record&amp;rsquo;s event or censoring time. This is the default behaviour of stpm2.
One of the advantages of parametric survival models is that we can predict various quantities (hazard, survival functions etc etc) at any value of time and for any covariate pattern as we have an equation which is a function of time and any covariates we have modelled.</description>

      <title>stcrprep - computational benefits</title>

      <guid>/software/stcrprep/computational_benefits/</guid>
      <description>When using stcrprep there are some computational benefits when compared to using Stata&amp;rsquo;s inbuilt stcrreg. One reason for this is that everytime you fit a model using stcrreg you the probability of censoring weights are calculated and the data must be expanded (in the background) when maximising the likelihood. When using stcrprep you only need to do this once.
I have run some timings. If I fit a simple model to the embt1 data with risk score as the only covariate (2 dummy variables) then these are the timings no my current work laptop (Intel i5 - running Stata 15 MP2).</description>

      <description>stcrprep prepares data for estimating and modelling cause-specific cumulative incidence functions using time-dependent weights. Once the data has been prepared and the weights incorporated using stset it is possible to obtain a graph of the non-parametric estimates of the cause-specific cumulative incidence function using sts graph. In addition a model that estimates subhazard ratios (equivalent to the Fine and Gray model) can be fitted using stcox. It is also possible to fit parametric models to directly estimate the cause-specific CIF (my main reason for developing the command).</description>

      <description>stpm2 fits flexible parametric survival models. These models use splines to model some transformation of the survial function. The most common is the $\log[-\log[S(t)]]$ link function, which fits proportional hazards models.
I have added some examples and aim to add to these.

      <title>Standardized survival functions</title>

      <guid>/software/stpm2_standsurv/standardized_survival/</guid>
      <description>Background When we are performing data exploration on survival data we usually start with plotting Kaplan-Meier curves. In clinical trials with a survival outcome, one would nearly always expect to see a Kaplan-Meier curve plotted. They are simple to interpret (though there can be confusion when there are competing risks).
In observational studies, we expect that there will be confounding and would usually adjust for these confounders in a Cox model.</description>

      <description>I will use the same data set I use in the Stata Journal article on stcrprep. This comprises of 1977 patients from the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry who received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Time is measured in days from transplantation to either relapse or death. There is only one covariate of interest, the EBMT risk score, which has been categorized into 3 groups (low, medium and high risk).</description>
