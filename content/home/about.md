# Background

I am a Professor of Biostatistics working in the [Biostatistics Research Group](http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/health-sciences/research/biostats) in the Department of Health Sciences at the University of Leicester, UK. I also work part-time in the [Biostatistics Group](http://ki.se/en/meb/biostatisticians) in the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

I have a variety of interests, mainly in the area of survival analysis in epidemiology. Much of my work focuses on the analysis from data from national cancer registries. I particularly enjoy writing [software]({{< ref "#software" >}}) to enable transferral of new methods into practice.

I enjoy [teaching]({{< ref "#teaching" >}}) and have developed some [interactive graphs](interactivegraphs/) to help with communication. Related to this we have developed interative graphs to display various cancer survival measures, called [InterPret](www.interpret.le.ac.uk).
