My main teaching is on the [MSc Medical Statisics](https://le.ac.uk/courses/medical-statistics-msc) at the University of Leicester. I took this course in $1991 \backslash 1992$.

- Survival Analysis
- Advanced Survival Analysis

I also teach a number of short courses. These include,

- [Statistical methods for population based cancer survival analysis (with Paul Dickman)](http://cansurv.net/)
- Flexible parametric survival models in epidemiology
