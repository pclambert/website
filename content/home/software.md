I have developed a number of Stata commands. I have added some examples of using this code and intend to add to these over time.

- [**stpm2**]({{< ref "software/stpm2.md" >}}) - flexible parametric survival models
- **rcsgen** - generate restricted cubic splines
- **stpm2_standsurv** - standardized survival curves after fitting an `stpm2` model
- **stpm2cif** - cause-specific cumulative incidence function after fitting a stpm2 competing risks model
- [**stcrprep**]({{< ref "software/stcrprep.md" >}}) - data-preparation command to fit a range of competing risks models.
- **partpred** - partial predictions
- **strcs** - flexible parametric model on log hazard scale

I have also worked with [Michael Crowther](http://www.mjcrowther.co.uk/#software) on various bits of software. Michael is a much better programmer than me!
