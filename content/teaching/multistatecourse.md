I am teaching a new three day course with [Michael Crowther](http://www.mjcrowther.co.uk/) on competing risks and multi-state models at the Swiss Epidemiology Winter School, 15th-18th January 2018. Details on how to register can be found [here](https://www.epi-winterschool.org/).

Practicals will be conducted in Stata, making use of the `multistate` package in Stata. 

We plan to run this course in Leicester and in Stockholm, sometime in 2018.
