I have had to move my webpage as the my university was closing down the server where the last one was hosted. I used this "opportunity" to create a new webpage using the excellent guide provided [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and some advice from [Michael Crowther](http://mjcrowther.co.uk) who has recently started his new website. 

This is my first ever blog and at the moment I am unsure how often I will do this, but my noble aim when developing this site is to be more active in adding examples and code. I have benefited a lot from many others posting code etc and I feel that this is often the best way of not reinventing the wheel. I also get various emails on the use of some of the commands I have written and many of them will hopefully be answered by referral to a an example on here. Some future requests may turn into new tutorials or blogs.
