## Background

In the previous tutorial I used `stpm2_standsurv` to obtain standardized survival functions. In this tutorial I show the first of a 
number of different measures of the standardized survival function where I obtain centiles of the standardized survival function.

As a reminder a centiles of a survival function can be obtanined by solving $S(t) = \alpha$ for $t$. For simple parametric distributions, such as the Weibull, this can be done analytically, but for more complex models the centile is obtained analytically. This what is done when using `stpm2`. 

The centile of a standardized survival function is obtained by solving the following equation for t. 

$$
E\left(S(t | X=x,Z\right) = \alpha
$$

This is done through root finding (using Brent's root finder) by solving

$$
\sum_{i=1}^N {S(t | X=x,Z)} - \alpha = 0
$$

Variances can be obtained using M-estimation.

## Example

I use a colon cancer example. I first load and `stset` the data

```stata
<<dd_do>>
//use https://www.pclambert.net/data/colon, clear
use c:/cansurv/data/colon, clear
drop if stage==0
stset surv_mm, f(status=1,2) scale(12) exit(time 120)
<</dd_do>>
```

I drop those with missing stage information (`stage == 0`). I am investigating all cause survival (`status=1,2`).

I fit a model that includes stage, sex and age (using a rectriced cubic splines). I assume proportional hazards, but if I relax this assusmption the syntax for `stpm2_standsurv` would be identical. Stage is classified as local, regional and distant and is modelled using two dummatu covariates with local as the reference category.


```stata
<<dd_do>>
tab stage, gen(stage)
gen female = sex==2
rcsgen age, df(3) gen(agercs) center(60)
stpm2 stage2 stage3 female agercs*, scale(hazard) df(4) nolog eform
<</dd_do>>
```

The is a clear effect of stage with a hazard ratio of 5.66 for distant stage versus local stage. Remember that I am modelling allÂ¨cause survival and one would expect a cause-specific hazard ratio to be higher. The all-cause mortality rate for females is 14% lower tham males.

I will now predict the standardized survival function, one where I force all subjects to be male and one where I force everyone to be female.


```stata
<<dd_do>>
range tt 0 10 100
stpm2_standsurv, at1(female 0) at2(female 1) timevar(tt) atvar(ms_male ms_female) ci
twoway	(line ms_male ms_female tt, sort) ///
		, yline(0.5, lpattern(dash) lcolor(black)) ///
		yline(0.5, lpattern(dash) lcolor(black)) ///
		xtitle("Years since diagnosis") ///
		ytitle("S(t)", angle(h)) ///
		ylabel(0(0.2)1, format(%3.1f) angle(h)) ///
		legend(order(1 "Male" 2 "Female") ring(0) pos(1) cols(1))
<</dd_do>>
```

The graph of the two standardised survival functions can be seen below.

As expected (given the hazard ratio) females have better survival than males. I have added a horizontal reference line at $S(t) 0.5$. Where thhis line crosses the survival curves gives the median survival time. Reading from the graph, this is just under 2 years for the males and just under 2.5 years for females. Using the `centile` option of `stpm2_standsurv` will estimate these values more accurately with 95% confidenec intervals. We are also interested in contrasts of the centiles and 

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm2_standsurv, at1(female 0) at2(female 1) timevar(tt) centile(50) ///
		atvar(med_male med_female) contrast(difference) ci
list med_male* in 1	
list med_female* in 1	
list _contrast* in 1
<</dd_do>>
```

The median survival time is 1.98 years for males with a 95% CI (1.87 to 2.09). The median for females is 2.42 years (95% CI, 2.30 to 2.56). As I use the `contrast` option I also get the difference in the median of the standardised survival curves with a 95% CI. Thus the time at which 50% of females have died is 0.44 years more than the time at which 50% of males have died, 95% CI (0.30 to 0.59).

It is possible to predict for multiple centiles by passing a **numlist** to the `centiles` option. For example, the code below calculations centiles xxx

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm2_standsurv, at1(female 0) at2(female 1) timevar(tt) centile(10(10)60) ///
		atvar(cen_males cen_females) contrast(difference) ci ///
		centvar(centiles) contrastvar(cendiff)
list centile cen_males cen_females cendiff in 1/6, sep(0) noobs
<</dd_do>>
```

I would like to acknowledge David Druker of StataCorp who I discussed these ideas with at two Nordic Stata User group meetings. David has written a command that estimates centiles of standardized distributions using a two parameter gamma distribution which is available [here]{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263218606_Quantile_treatment_effect_estimation_from_censored_data_by_regression_adjustment}.
